OpenPharmacophore
=================

OpenPharmacophore is a library to work with pharmacophore models and perform virtual screening. It 
can derive pharmacophores from ligand-based as well as structured-based methods. It also offers
the possibility to derive pharmacophores from molecular dynamics trajectories.
